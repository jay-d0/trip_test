Attraction,Summary,Latitude,Longitude
Louvre Museum,Louvre museum is a world class museum. It's too crowded to see all the important pieces. The maps are useless and the galleries are numbered way up high and hard to see. Mona Lisa was rammed but elsewhere was not crowded. The museum is expensive but it's worth the visit.,48.86073106,2.338287727
Eiffel Tower,"The Eiffel Tower is beautiful and awe inspiring when seen up close and personal. Jack recommends getting tickets in advance and trying to go as early in the day as possible to avoid crowds. He recommends going to the summit first, then the second level and down to the first level. Jack and his wife went to the tower on a Thursday evening at 9:30 pm.",48.85844772,2.294803162
Seine River,Take a boat ride on the Seine River to see Paris from a different angle. Watch for the Eiffel Tower's light show in the early evening. Take a batobus or bateaux mouches that offer narrated cruises with or without meals.,48.69549507,2.578481696
Cathedrale Notre-Dame,"After the fire some years ago, Notre Dame has been closed to the public, but it's still impressive to see from the outside. It's still worthwhile to go, but don't plan on tours any time soon. There are bleachers outside so people can watch the repair work going on.",48.853039,2.350352834
Versaille,"There are many more interesting and accessible places in Paris than Versailles. The rooms are filled with paintings of former monarchs and their families. The museum's audio guide doesn't tell a compelling story. The gardens are nice for walking but lack shade unless you get pretty far outside the palace. The little tourist train will cost, but it drops you off at the Grand Trianon and it's free.",48.80501326,2.121074229
Saint-Chapelle,"The Sainte Chapelle was built to hold the relics belonging to the Royal family and has magnificent stain glass windows. It's a short walk from the Louvre and offers free access with the Paris Museum Pass. The chapel is smaller than expected, but it's beautiful and intimate. The concert at Saint Chapelle last Saturday evening was very poor.",48.85548792,2.345636814
Sacre-Coeur Basilique,"There are nearly 40,000 Tripadvisor reviews on the site about Basilique Du Sacre Coeur De Montmartre. It's a national monument in France,constructed between 1875-1914 and built from designs from architect Paul Abadie. The biggest complaint from tourists is running the gauntlet of aggressive panhandlers and con artists lurking around the staircase leading up to the church.",48.88685978,2.343973333
Pantheon,"The Pantheon was built as a church in honor of Paris patron Saint St. Geneivive. It became a mausoleum after the famous Victor Hugo was buried here.

Orsay Museum,Musee d'Orsay was a highlight on our recent trip to Europe. The impressionist paintings were truly amazing and the rest of the museum is very well done. Go straight to the 5th floor to get the full impressionist experience. Prebooking your tickets is highly recommended in order to avoid waiting time.,48.86008137,2.326947635
Orangerie Museum,"Monet's Water Lilies are on display in the Tuileries Garden. The Matisse exhibit was interesting but the Monets are the main draw. The museum footprint is small compared to others like the Louvre and Orsay, but the quality is outstanding. The staff were helpful because we had the wrong tickets for the wrong date.",48.86384484,2.3233805
Montmartre,"Montmartre is one of the most beautiful districts of Paris. The best part was climbing the dome, 292 steps up a steep and winding staircase to the top to have a full view of Paris, great photo opportunity and a good work out for the legs. The area was one of his favorite places during his visit to Paris.",48.8860343,2.343062981
Disneyland,"Walt Disney Studios is a great park with good rides for all the family. Disney World Paris was a good experience for my son and his family. They enjoyed star tours, pirates of the Caribbean web was a new ride and they enjoyed it very much. They had a fantastic dinner experience with the characters of the Disney princesses, mickey and friendly staff of restaurants. Their visit was spoiled by the protests.",48.86754809,2.784344015
Centre Pompidou,Centre Pompidou is one of the most interesting museums in Paris. The modern part on the fifth floor represents the period between 1905 and 1965. The contemporary art is located on the fourth floor and contains many interesting works of art created after 1965. It can be difficult to know how to transverse between the floors but not the worst than the Louvre.,48.8607055,2.352920914
Moulin Rouge,"A year ago my family went to Paris to see the Moulin Rouge show. They enjoyed the show, but they didn't like the use of live animals and some of the performers were not very entertaining. They will go again in February 2020. They paid 200$ for a ticket and some champagne. ",48.88419372,2.332723966
Arc de Triomphe,"Arc de Triomphe is a must-see Paris attraction. It's located in a roundabout, where some streets converge. There are 300+ stairs to the top, but the view makes it worth it. The views from the terrace are very much appreciated. The view from the top is amazing. It was my favorite place in our 12 days in Paris.",48.87386284,2.295142541
Montparnasse,Montparnasse Tower is a good alternative to the Eiffel Tower. The view from the top is better than the exterior. It's cheaper and there's a nice view of Paris. The app didn't work very well and the information given there was limited.,48.84224379,2.321972855
Champs-Elysees,"The Champs-Elysees is one of the world's most famous avenues full of top end stores. The Marais district is not the best place for shopping in Paris, but it's a great place to visit the world-class sites. The Champs Elysees has all of Manhattan beat in his opinion.",48.87305683,2.298344193
Concorde,The place where Louis XV and Marie Antoinette met their fate at the guillotine is full of history. The Egyptian Obelisk brought from the Luxor Temple is the oldest structure in Paris.

Catacombs,"The catacombs got cancelled twice in March and the refund will take months, so don't prebook, just turn up and pay on the door. Stsff were nice enough but audio guide was poor. The audio tour is on a speaker so when there is a few people around it can be a lot of the echoes of the same sentences.",48.83400196,2.332990825
Luxembourg Gardens,"Le Jardin du Luxembourg is one of the most beautiful parks in Paris. Marie de' Medici (Queen of France, but regent when her son became king) built the Luxembourg Palace and the gardens. Many Parisiens have a picnic on the grass in a quiet corner of the park.

The use of the historical Invalide buildings imposes restrictions for exhibition spaces.",48.85595563,2.312003311
Bateaux Pariseins,"The dinner cruise on the Seine was a great way to end the trip in Paris. The food was wonderful, staff welcoming, service superb, views brilliant and the cruise calm. The route took in all the major views from the Statue of Liberty & The Seine all the way to the National Library. The boat was high quality with great visibility.",48.86050497,2.294337473
Big Bus,Booked a tour with them last weekend for 2 adults and 2 kids aged 4 and 1.5. Disappointed with their service. Missed two buses due to being unable to get pram on. Paid extra for a river cruise and a boat trip in darkness.,48.86538702,2.334829508
Chateau de Fontainebleau,"Chateau de Fontainebleau-Avon is one of the most famous and amazing castles in France. The gardens are huge, perfectly maintained and inviting.

The Chapelle Chapel is a beautiful stained glass window chapel.,48.85620197,2.34602101
Crazy Horse,"Before the show program with ""Crazy Entertainers, George Bangable, and his delicious diva, Lolly Wish"" was cheap, below the level of the audience and not entertaining at all. The production was spectacular, especially the lighting. The show was fun and sexy with the perfect dose of humour. The seating area is very small and they pack you in like sardines.",48.86603923,2.302374523
Fondation Louis Vuitton,"The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris is one of the best places to visit in Paris. The Monet Mitchell exhibition was nice, but the best part of the Foundation visit for them was the remarkable architecture and views of Paris from the top areas. The Morozov Collection in the Morozova Museum in St. Petersburg was a revelation. The New World of Charlotte Perriand is on display.",48.87680051,2.264371475
Grevin Museum,"Grevin museum is a must-see place at Paris. It's a museum with wax statues of famous people of the arts, the cinema, the science and the history.

Le Bon Marche,Le Bon Marche Gauche is an amazing store. It was packed with Christmas decorations and had a selection packed with small vendors.

Picasso Museum,"Some recent reviews of the Picasso Museum have been surprisingly negative. For me it was a first-rate collection of Picasso's work. The new museum is a sterile atmosphere with such a small selection of his works that it is bordering on deceptive to name it ""Musee Picasso-Paris"". The Faith Ringgold exhibit on the first floor was fantastic.",48.85972624,2.363213167
