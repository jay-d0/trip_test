The views from the terrace are very much appreciated. The view from the top is amazing. It was my favorite place in our 12 days in Paris.",

The contemporary art is located on the fourth floor and contains many interesting works of art created after 1965. It can be difficult to know how to transverse between the floors but not the worst than the Louvre.",
